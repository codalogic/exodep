# exodep
Exodep is a basic tool for downloading dependent files from github-like
repositories.

# Getting Started
You'll need Python 3 on your system.  Once you've got that installed,
simply copy `exodep.py` to your repo, most likely placing it in its
top-level directory.  You can then create a `mydeps.exodep` file, as
described below, that tells exodep what to do.

# Testing
Open a shell and cd to the `test` directory.  Then run `exodep-unittest.py`.
